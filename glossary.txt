Notation used for specifying the syntax of programming -> CFG
A grammar consists of the sequence of rule, also known as productions.

Tokens are terminal while variable like expressions are non-terminal.

The non-terminal symbol on the left side of the first rule is called as start symbol.

| --> OR. So (ADD | SUB) means either Add or Sub.
(...) --> An opening and closing paranthesis means grouping
of terminals and/or non-terminal as in (ADD | SUB)
(...)* --> Match content within the group zero or more times.
